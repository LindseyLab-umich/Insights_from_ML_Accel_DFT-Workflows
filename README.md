# ChIMES Silicon Phase-Diagram Workflows

LAMMPS workflows for mapping the high-pressure phase behaviour of silicon with
[ChIMES](https://github.com/rk-lindsey/chimes_calculator) machine-learned
interatomic potentials. The three folders cover the three calculations needed
to build a P–T phase diagram:

| Folder | What it computes | Main outputs |
|---|---|---|
| [`Example_TI/`](Example_TI/README.md) | Finite-temperature Gibbs free energies by Frenkel–Ladd thermodynamic integration (TI) to an Einstein crystal | ΔG(P) curves per phase, solid–solid transition pressures with uncertainties |
| [`Example_NPH/`](Example_NPH/README.md) | Melting points by solid–liquid two-phase coexistence (NPH) | Coexistence temperature at a given pressure, plus a q̄₆ order-parameter profile across the interface |

All simulations use `units real` (energies in kcal/mol, pressures in atm,
lengths in Å, time in fs).

## Requirements

**Simulation**

- LAMMPS built with the ChIMES pair style (`pair_style chimesFF`). See the
  [ChIMES calculator](https://github.com/rk-lindsey/chimes_calculator) for
  build instructions.
- A ChIMES parameter file for Si. The inputs expect files named `params.txt`
  (E–V) and `params.txt.reduced` (TI, NPH). **These files are not included in
  this repository**, so supply your own (see [Parameter files](#parameter-files)).
- For TI: a SLURM cluster. `sbatch.cmd` was written for TACC Stampede3
  (`ibrun`, Intel MPI) and needs editing for other machines.

**Analysis**

Python 3.9+ with the packages in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Parameter files

Every LAMMPS input loads the potential with a relative path, e.g.

```
pair_coeff * * ../../../params.txt.reduced
```

These paths match the directory layout the workflows were first run in and
differ between folders. The most reliable fix is to point them at an absolute
path before running.
